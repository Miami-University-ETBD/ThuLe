      <ul>
        <li>I am a junior majoring in Data Science & Statistics with a minor in ETBD. Just recently, during the winter break, 
          I looked at my design projects I did before and think about how much I enjoyed doing that stuff, I decided to declare 
          ETBD minor. Though it's only been a short amount of time, I really enjoy all the IMS courses I'm taking now.</li>
        <li>I am an international student from Viet Nam, a beautiful country in Southeast Asia.</li>
        <li>I really love travelling!!! I have been to 12 states in the US and 10 different countries, might not be the "wow" 
          numbers of places but I feel very lucky to have those opportunity to travel.</li>
      </ul>  
      <p><u>About the photo here</u>: This is me in my national costume - Ao Dai. This was during national holiday in Viet Nam, and some other 
      Asian countries, people usually put on national costumes and go around the city to take photos.</p>
